## Hey, I'm Bailey![](assets/img/bailey.jpg){ align=right : width=300; height=150}
I'm a **Software Engineering** and **Linguistics** student based in DFW.
I have interests in music, writing, and other areas that I'd like to share.
## What is Knothole?
Knothole is a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history?ref=ideasurg.pub) housing all the things I want the world to see. I got it's name from the place where Boo Radley would communicate with the Finch children in *To Kill a Mockingbird*. When we read that book for class in 8th grade, I was given the nickname "Boo Radley," and ever since then I've embraced it fully.
